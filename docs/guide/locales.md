# multi-language

Convue will load the .js|.ts file in the /src/locales directory by default, and pass it in when vue-i18n is instantiated.

The naming of files should follow the rules as far as possible.

## Hot reload

When the contents of files under /src/locales are modified, they will also be hot reloaded to facilitate development.

For other rules, please [refer to locale configuration items](/convue/config/locale).
